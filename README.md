Qualtrics-Peer-Reports

Qualtrics is a powerful online survey tool to create complex surveys that meet a variety of needs. Utrecht University has developed an extension to the standard Qualtrics package that makes it possible to use peer assessment techniques, both peer nominations (e.g., “Which children in your class help others?”) and peer ratings (e.g., “How much do you like ….. [group member]”).

In addition, there are several possibilities to export and analyse the data, including calculation of the indegree, the outdegree, the average received rating, and the adjacency matrix for social network analysis. The package contains a manual, a template to easily create your own peer reports survey, Excel files for importing group members and exporting data, as well as the functional specifications with a brief introduction to peer reports.
